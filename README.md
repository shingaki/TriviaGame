## Welcome Trivia Game

This game is based on the prime time cartoons such as: Family Guy, The Simpsons, and American Dad. How familiar are you with these cartoons. This game will test your prime-time IQ. 

## My Analysis

Before I started building my application, I had to do some research. I researched to find the common things about each cartoon. Once I had a total of 10 items, I began writing my application.

## My Approach

- I captured the graphics needed for my game.
- I created an array of objects. Each object contained a question and multiple choice answers as well as attributes and the path to the graphic for that particular answer. 
- First, I created the code to display the question and answers (without the timers). 
- Second, I created the code for the timer.
- Third, I tied the timer to the display of the question and answers (switching to another question, etc. after 30 seconds).
- Fourth, I created the restart game feature.
